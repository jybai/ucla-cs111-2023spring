## Pipe Up

This lab implements the `pipe` operator in shells by connecting the inputs and outputs of programs sequentially.

## Building

Compile the program by running `make`.

## Running

Example input:
```
./pipe ls cat wc
```

Expected output: 
```
      10      10      99
```

## Cleaning up

Remove the compiled results and binaries with `make clean`.
